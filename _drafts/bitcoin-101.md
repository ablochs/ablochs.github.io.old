## Lecture 1 - What is money?

1. Means of exchange
2. Store value
3. Unit of account

- Divisibility
- Durability
- Fungibility
- Verifiability

### Why is money worth anything?

- People must agree to exchange goods and services for the money
- Authority must validate and maintain the currency
- Currencies are generally backed by something

### The problem with regular money
- A small group of people decide how to regulate and manage the currency
- Online exchange lacks any notion of privacy
- You have to trust one nation at a time
- You must have faith in entities like banks and paypal

### Solution to problems? Bitcoin
- Replaces the middleman with decentralized peer-to-peer system governed by open sourced algos
- The bitcoin system is a collection of clients analogus to torrrent clients downloading a file
- Every bitcoin client has a record of every single transaction and the amout of bitcoins in each accout
- Account are anonymous. The are just public key addresses without any personally identifiable information attached
- When someone wishes to spend a bitcoin, he uses a seret key associated with his account and enters the address he wants to send bitcoins to
- The network verfies all transactions automatically

### Why are Bitcoin special?
- Has a max circulation of just under 21 mio. coins (reached in 2140) causing the value of each coin to increase over time
- Intrinsically deflational currency (becomes more valuable over time)
- Every transaction is verified by the entire Bitcoin network making it nearly impossible to counterfeit a Bitcoin
- All transactions are known, but there is no identity attached to the transaction - only bitcoin addresses
- Due to their decentralized nature, no one government can effectively regulaate or control Bitcoin. It would require the consent of the entire internet
- Combines the scarcity of gold with the divisibility of digital currencies. A Bitcoin can be divided as small as 0.00000001
- Transactions are permanent removing the notion of a chargeback
- Account can never be frozen be a government
- Sending Bitcoins is as simple as sending an email

### Who controls the Bitcoin?
- Who controls a torrent?
- As a peer-to-peer system, the entire network have to agree on the rules beforehand. Once this is done, it is nearly impossible to undo
- Thus, no one person or group can ever control the Bitcoin

### Why are Bitcoin worth anything?
- Every currency is priced according to its supply and demand and what people are willing to exchange for it in terms of goods and services
- Due to its non-affiliation with any government or corporation alongside the intrinsic privacy from the networkâ€™s design, the Bitcoin has a minimum value. This value is the price the internet puts on anonymity and protection from inflation or manipulation
- As more people use the Bitcoin for goods and services, it will increase in value because the supply cannot keep up with demand. This makes the Bitcoin inherently deflationary
