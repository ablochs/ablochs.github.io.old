In a Bitcoin wallet you store the private key, which gives you access to public Bitcoin address and sign transactions.
It depends how you manage them. The private keys stored in your wallet are the only way to access the transaction data stored in a bitcoin address. If you lose them, you lose your bitcoins. So, they are only safe in so far as no one else can access them, and they don’t get lost.

Depending on the security levels you want, different wallets will provide different levels of security. Some act like everyday spending accounts and are comparable to a traditional leather wallet, while others tout military-grade protections.

## Types of wallets

### Desktop wallets
Full Bitcoin client. Download the entire blockchain.

### Mobile wallets
Running as an app on your smartphone, the wallet can store the private keys for your bitcoin addresses, and enable you to pay for things directly with your phone.
- Can work with NFC
- Not full Bitcoin client
- Keeps Bitcoin keys encryptet and backed up on server

### Online wallets
- Store private keys on server
- Pros: Can access from anywhere
- Cons: Unless implemented correctly, they can put the organisation running the website in charge of your private keys – essentially taking your bitcoins out of your control.

### Hardware wallets
- Dedicated devices that can hold private keys electronically and facilitate payments.
- For bitcoiners who wish to maintain a substantial stash of coins, but do not want to rely on third-party bitcoin storage services or impractical forms of cold storage.

### Paper wallets
- Pros: The benefit of a paper wallet that is made correctly is that the private keys are not stored digitally anywhere, and are therefore not subject to standard cyber-attacks or hardware failures.

## How to secure a wallet
- Encrypt
- Backup
- Multi-signature
- Store it offline
