## Building a segment/list
Narrow your list down to users with most buying potential (the segment size must not be below 100 people).

The best way to create a segment, is to go to GA's reporting tab and click `Audience > Overview > + NEW SEGMENT`

When the segment is created you can import it in the GA admin: `Remarketing > Audiences + NEW AUDIENCE`. Select View and Account and click Next. In Define Audience click Import Segment and select the Segment you just defined in reporting.

## Build remarketing campaign in Google Adwords
Go to your Adwords account and click `Campaigns > Shared Library > Audiences` and select the segment you just created.

## Types of retargeting
Site-wide (general) vs Dynamic
