        You often raise € 100 000 – € 500 000, depending on what you need to reach the next stage.

        <br>
        If the investors believe in your product and ambitions, and you are a first time entrepreneurs, then the valuation is € 2 million. If you are a second time- or experienced entrepreneur, you can often get a € 3 or € 4 million valuation instead.
        <br>
        <br>
        These general rules exist because nobody wants to waste time – and arguing about valuation at an early stage startup is nearly impossible.

        An important thing, that many stressed, is that after the series A round the founders still need to own over 50% of the company. That the original founders still control the company and have a strong incentive to do their best, was a very important detail for all serious VCs I talked to.
