      <td>You’ll probably need another $200,000 to finish your product and do an alpha or beta test.</td>
      <td>Participants are typically the micro VCs who write $500k-1m checks, or select VCs who like to dip down into angel from time to time (Fred Wilson is writing angel checks again — there’s a signal!). They’re happy to pay $500k to get 10% of the business, knowing that you have some amount of product & market fit — or at least a product that is slick and they can play with.</td>
