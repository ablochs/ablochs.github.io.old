## Stage 1
Product Progress: You have no product, just an idea or wireframes.

5% of your company for $50,000

## STAGE TWO: $2M INFLUENCER ROUND
Product Progress: You have a prototype or raw MVP.

You’ll probably need another $200,000 to finish your product and do an alpha or beta test.

## STAGE THREE: $4-6M ANGEL ROUND
Product Progress: Your product MVP is done and you’ve done some consumer testing. 

Participants are typically the micro VCs who write $500k-1m checks, or select VCs who like to dip down into angel from time to time (Fred Wilson is writing angel checks again — there’s a signal!). They’re happy to pay $500k to get 10% of the business, knowing that you have some amount of product & market fit — or at least a product that is slick and they can play with.
